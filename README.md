# Every Day Calendar with the Coding Train

![Daniel sitting in the dark with the every day calendar behind him. He touches it once turns back to the camera and smiles as a single ball falls and bounces on the low resolution screen. Touches it again and two more balls fall and he rases his hands. Then touches it many time as a cascade of balls fall and bounce around, turning back to the camera one last time he dances with joy.](/images/bouncingballs.gif)
